💳 ATM System in Java
This project is a simple console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation, built using Java. It allows users to perform basic banking operations, just like a real ATM, through a text-based menu system.

✅ Features
🔐 User Login – Login using account number and PIN

💰 Check Balance – View your current account balance

➕ Deposit Money – Add money to your account

➖ Withdraw Money – Take money out of your account (with balance check)

📜 Transaction History – View past transactions (if implemented)

🚪 Exit – Safely exit the system

🧱 Technologies Used
Java – Core language

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) – Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation

Collections – Used ArrayList, HashMap, etc. for storing accounts and transactions

Scanner – For user input from the terminal

🧩 Project Structure
ATM.java – Main class to handle ATM operations

Account.java – Stores user account information like balance, PIN, etc.

Transaction.java (optional) – Keeps track of deposits and withdrawals

Main.java – Entry point that runs the ATM system

💡 How It Works
The user is asked to enter their account number and PIN

If authenticated, a menu appears with all available operations

The user can perform actions like deposit, withdraw, check balance, etc.

The session continues until the user selects Exit

📂 Future Improvements (Optional)
Add file storage or database support

Create a GUI using Swing or JavaFX

Add admin panel to manage user accounts

Improve error handling and security

That's all !! ⭐⭐
